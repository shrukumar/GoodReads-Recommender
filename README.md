# GoodReads-Recommender
This is a GoodReads Recommendation system that allows users to input a link to their desired GoodReads bookshelf and input a criteria to get a book suggestion that is already within their bookshelf. This system was created to minimize the trend of overconsumption within the book community, in which readers are buying new books faster than they can read the ones they already have. By website scraping (BS4), K-Means Clustering, TF-IDF Vectorization, and cosine similarity, we are able to create a basic content-based recommendation system. 

This project was created as a final project for Northeastern University's DS3000 course, Foundations of Data Science. Collaborators on this project were Shrutika Kumar, Madeleine Jin, Melina Yang, and Grace Pietak in December 2023.
